    "text": "The New York City’s new Commission to Analyze Taxpayer Spending (CATS) intended to understand the city’s expenses and wondered if there were any opportunities to spend taxpayers’ money more efficiently. As a senior technical analyst, I will help analyze the city payroll and identify the instances where senior agency officials make significantly more than rank-and-file city employees. I will use City payroll data from NYC Open Data and highlight possible savings to be submitted to the commission."
